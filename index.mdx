## The Problem We’re Solving

Most internal and admin applications are built from the same ingredients: tables, forms, and record detail screens. Yet
teams repeatedly re-implement these patterns, losing time to boilerplate and micro-inconsistencies — small differences
in layout, behaviour, validation, or interaction that quietly erode usability and development speed.

Tools that optimise for speed often do so by tightly coupling UI, state, and server logic. This can lead to sluggish
interactions on complex pages and makes customisation increasingly difficult. When requirements inevitably grow beyond
the default patterns, teams are often forced into full rewrites, discarding earlier work.

Our aim is to remove this trade-off: fast to build at the start, flexible and performant as complexity increases.

## Our Approach

We use a page-first, schema-driven model built on classic Laravel controllers and Inertia.
- Developers define pages in PHP using schemas that describe intent: fields, columns, validation, actions.
- Base controllers handle routing, data loading, validation, and responses.
- The frontend renders pages using fast, client-side Vue components, with data fetched via lightweight JSON endpoints.
- Core Inertia primitives (such as useForm) remain first-class and fully accessible.

For more complex screens, pages are composed from blocks:
- detail blocks for read-only fields
- table blocks for related data
- inline form blocks for scoped edits
- custom blocks for bespoke UI

Each block is independently powered and can load data lazily, keeping pages responsive even as functionality grows.

## Why This Works
- Performance by default: UI interactions are client-side; the server focuses on data and validation.
- Progressive customisation: override a field, a block, or a single page without abandoning schemas or shared logic.
- Composable complexity: record “view” pages are built by combining blocks, not by introducing special-case abstractions.
- Familiar foundations: standard Laravel controllers, Inertia pages, and Vue components.
- No wasted effort: schemas, validation rules, actions, and endpoints remain useful even as pages evolve.

The result is a system optimised for speed without regret: rapid delivery of simple CRUD screens, and a clear,
maintainable path to richer, more interactive pages when you need them.
