## Ambition

### The Problem We’re Solving

Most internal and admin applications are made up of the same two screens, over and over again: tables and forms. Yet
teams repeatedly rebuild these from scratch, burning time on boilerplate instead of solving real business problems.

Frameworks that promise speed often achieve it by tightly coupling UI, state, and server logic. This works well at
first, but as screens become more complex, performance degrades and customisation becomes difficult. At that point, the
only escape is usually a full rewrite — throwing away the productivity gains that got you there.

Our goal is simple: make the common case extremely fast, without creating a dead end when things get complex.

### Our Approach

We take a page-first, schema-driven approach built on familiar Laravel controllers and Inertia.
- Developers define pages (lists, create, edit, etc.) using PHP schemas that describe intent: fields, columns, validation, actions.
- Base controllers handle the plumbing: routing, data loading, validation, and responses.
- The frontend renders these pages using fast, client-side Vue components, with data fetched via lightweight JSON endpoints.
- Inertia’s own primitives (like useForm) remain first-class — nothing fundamental is hidden or wrapped.

For speed, a schema can give you a fully working CRUD page with almost no frontend code.
For flexibility, every layer can be overridden incrementally:
- swap a field or table cell
- customise part of a page layout
- eject a single page into a custom Vue component
- keep using the same schema and core logic throughout

### Why This Works
- Performance by default: UI interactions are client-side; the server focuses on data and validation.
- No abstraction cliff: you can customise one page or one component without abandoning the system.
- Familiar mental model: classic Laravel controllers, Inertia pages, and Vue components.
- Work is never wasted: schemas, validation rules, and actions remain useful even as pages become more custom.

The result is a system optimised for speed without regret: rapid development for simple screens, and a clear, safe path
to full customisation when you need it.
